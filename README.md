eurorack analog modular synthesizer


We built a few modules in the eurorack format and wanted to share what we learn with you. Building a synthesizer is a good start point for a beginner because it teaches you the basics while being fun. Plus everything that you do can be heard directly in the sound so you will understand what is the use of every component in a meaningful and concrete project. Moreover it can be interesting to build these modules by your own because it will be much cheaper than the average prices of the market.
